# PacMan

Written in C++14 using SFML 2.5.1 library for my object-oriented programming class on University.

In order to install SFML:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
Next, just launch with following commands:
```
$ g++ -c *.cpp
$ g++ -o PacMan *.o -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
$ ./PacMan
```
